# Node Challenge

Basic dynamic template handler.

Run `npm start` to start the project. Then you have to insert the path to the template *(it can be `index.html` or `template.html`)* and to the data files *(you can choose `data.json` or `new-data.json`)* via console.

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`, and you can see the result.
